# Danceinf

Danceinf is a Full Stack App where the user can help Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete ballet and dance companies information. Upon checkeing further in the community, I found no dance API just for ballets and dance companies so I created this app with the goal creating the first Ballet information API.


### Technologies used ðŸ’¾

- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Node JS
- Liquid
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Various node modules


# MODELS

The app has 3 models:

- Ballet Companies
- Ballet Shows
- Users

Each model carries it controller, schema and model with the data manually created. In the app, the user will help:

- Create
- Retrieve
- Update 
- Delete 

THe user will also help relate the companies that have been ablet to perform the ballet show as part of their repertoir. This data can also be deleted if needed be. This app is a RESTful CRUD API that the use will help build as a dance community.
